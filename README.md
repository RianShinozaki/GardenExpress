Real-Time Management & Spatial Strategy Placement Puzzle Game

Players must juggle customer requests, monument placements, and 
board expansions in real time to keep the thriving business of the garden.

The game takes place on a grid filled with monuments and every few seconds
a new customer will arrive with certain locations, preferences, and personalities.

Monuments have a radius of influence, allowing players to strategize
and prioritize certain customers. As the garden's business thrives,
the board expands and new monuments will be available to place.
